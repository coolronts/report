            In Lab 1, the temperature of the Air Heater has been collected using DAQ-6000, and signal has been passed to the LABVIEW in PC. In the Labview, PID controller, Low pass Pass Filter and Scaling has been used to control the output signal to reach the set-point and pass the output signal back to the Air Heater. The data had been stored in OPC server from the Labview. Moreover, the data data had been sent to MySQL server in Azure Database. After the database had been implementation where the data should be stored in the Cloud using Microsoft Azure. Beside creating database, the website has been created using ASP.Net to monitor the real time value.
            Cyber Security issues should also be considered.

                        <p>Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Industry 4.0, which encompasses IIoT and smart manufacturing, marries
                            physical production and operations with smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data to create a more holistic and better connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain management.
                            While every company and organization operating today is different, they all face a common challenge—the need for connectedness and access to real-time insights across processes, partners, products, and people.<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>The frequency response of a system is a frequency dependent function which expresses how a sinusoidal signal of a given frequency on the system input is transferred through the system. Each frequency component is a sinusoidal signal
                            having certain amplitude and a certain frequency. The frequency response is an important tool for analysis and design of signal filters and for analysis and design of control systems. The frequency response can be found experimentally
                            or from a transfer function model. The frequency response of a system is defined as the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input signal. When the system is in steady-state, it differs from the input signal
                            only in amplitude/gain (A) and phase lag (𝜙).<a href="#3">[3]</a></p>

                        <b>Tuning Method</b>
                        <p>Before the working of the PID controller takes place, it must be tuned to suit with dynamics of the process to be controlled. Designers give the default values for P, I, and D terms, and these values couldn’t give the desired performance
                            and sometimes leads to instability and slow control performances. Different types of tuning methods are developed to tune the PID controllers and require much attention from the operator to select the best values of proportional,
                            integral, and derivative gains. Some of these are given below. PID controllers are used in most industrial applications but one should know the settings of this controller to adjust it correctly to generate the preferred output.
                            Here, tuning is nothing but the procedure of receiving an ideal reply from the controller through setting best proportional gains, integral & derivative factors. The desired output of the PID controller can be obtained by tuning
                            the controller. There are different techniques available to get the required output from the controller like trial &error, Zeigler-Nichols & process reaction curve. The most frequently used methods are trial & error, Zeigler-Nichols,
                            etc.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <b> Zeigler-Nichols method:</b> Zeigler-Nichols proposed closed-loop methods for tuning the PID controller. Those are the continuous cycling method and damped oscillation method. Procedures for both methods are the same but
                                oscillation behavior is different.

                                In this, first, we have to set the p-controller constant, Kp to a particular value while Ki and Kd values are zero. Proportional gain is increased till the system oscillates at a constant amplitude. Gain at which system produces constant oscillations
                                is called ultimate gain (Ku) and the period of oscillations is called the ultimate period (Pc). Once it is reached, we can enter the values of P, I, and D in the PID controller by Zeigler-Nichols table</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Trial and Error Method:</b> It is a simple method of PID controller tuning. While the system or controller is working, we can tune the controller. In this method, first, we have to set Ki and Kd values to zero and increase
                                the proportional term (Kp) until the system reaches oscillating behavior. Once it is oscillating, adjust Ki (Integral term) so that oscillations stop and finally adjust D to get a fast response.</li>

                        <h3 id="OPC">OPC UA </h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>OPC is the most used versatile way to communicate in the automation layer in all types of industry. Over the years it has evolved from the start with simple Data access (DA) over Alarm & Events (AE) to the more advanced Historical
                            Data Access (HDA) to have quite extensive functionality and reach. </p>
                        <p>The most significant difference between classical OPC and OPC UA is that it doesn’t rely on OLE or DCOM technology from Microsoft that makes it possible to implement it on any platform if that being Apple, Linux (JAVA) or Windows.
                            The other very important part of UA is the possibility to use structures or models. This means that the data tags or points can be grouped and be given context which make governance and maintenance much easier. These models
                            can be identified in runtime which makes it possible for a client to explore connection possible by asking the server.</p>

                                <p>The information modelling is very modern in OPC UA. These models can be defined by manufactures or protocols like BACNet but it can also contain more of a MESH structure where very complex relations and connections between
                                    points and nodes can be defined. The possibility also exist to have data structures so that certain data always is grouped and handled as one piece. This is important in many application to be sure that the data set
                                    is taken at the same time.</p>

                                <p>OPC UA is as said before built to be platform independent and the communication is built into layers on top of the standard TCP/IP stack. Above the standard transport layers there are two layers, one that handles the session
                                    and one to establish a secure channel between the client and server. The transport layer is made up of TCP/IP and on top of that SSL, HTTP or HTTPS. The Communication layer secure the communication channel not just
                                    that the data is corrupted but also it secure the authentication so that the end points can’t be infiltrated and changed. This is based on X.509 certificates that have three parts to it and the first peer to peer trust
                                    needs to be manually done but after that the rest is taken care of securely.

                                <p>So far OPC UA are mostly used for bridging between different OPC servers, this is called tunneling. This is something that for example KEPServerEX OPC UA tunnel does. Other applications include the GE Global discovery server
                                    and the same control system that have full OPC UA support for browsing the data structures. This is still quite uncommon but the development goes fast and there is a lot of work done in order to include data models
                                    for transferring models from BACNet, ISA95 and PLCopen.</p>

                        <p>ASP.NET is a popular web-development framework for building web apps on the .NET platform. ASP.NET Core is the open-source version of ASP.NET, that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. ASP.NET Core was first released in 2016 and
                            is a re-design of earlier Windows-only versions of ASP.NET.</p>
                        <p>ASP.NET Core is designed to allow runtime components, APIs, compilers and languages evolve quickly, while still providing a stable and supported platform to keep apps running. Multiple versions of ASP.NET Core can exist side by
                            side on the same server. Meaning one app can adopt the latest version, while other apps keep running on the version they were tested on. ASP.NET Core provides various support lifecycle options to meet the needs of your app.
                            You can chose a long-term support release, or run with the latest release if you commit to upgrade more often.</p>
                        <p>ASP.NET apps can be developed and run on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker. The Visual Studio family of products has tools for building .NET apps on any operating system. There are also command line tools and extensions for many
                            popular edit</p>
                        <p>The ASP.NET Core runtime that your app runs on can be deployed as part of your app, or installed centrally on your web server. ASP.NET Core is also perfectly suited for Docker containers.

                        <p>Using the Ziegler-Nichols method, the Skogestad method was compared which was used. Skogestad method works better as the "Golden Rules" of stability analyzes states the Gain should be between 6-12dB and the PM should be between
                            30-60. After getting all the required values, the PI controller was implemented in the LabView, which was tested. And the data was sent to Azure SQL using OPC UA.png
