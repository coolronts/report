                        <p>Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Industry 4.0, which encompasses IIoT and smart manufacturing, marries
                            physical production and operations with smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data to create a more holistic and better connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain management.
                            While every company and organization operating today is different, they all face a common challenge—the need for connectedness and access to real-time insights across processes, partners, products, and people.<a href="#1">[1]</a></p>

                            it. Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number of reasons including cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security.<a href="#3">[3]</a></p>

                                <b>Saas</b>-Software as a Service
                                <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing,
                                    alongside infrastructure as a service and platform as a service (IaaS and PaaS). </p>
                                <p> SaaS is closely related to the application service provider (ASP) and on demand computing software delivery models. The hosted application management model of SaaS is similar to ASP, where the provider hosts the customer’s
                                    software and delivers it to approved end users over the internet</p>
                                <p>In the software on demand SaaS model, the provider gives customers network-based access to a single copy of an application that the provider created specifically for SaaS distribution. The application’s source code is the
                                    same for all customers and when new features or functionalities are rolled out, they are rolled out to all customers. Depending upon the service level agreement (SLA), the customer’s data for each model may be stored
                                    locally, in the cloud or both locally and in the cloud.</p>
                                <p>Organizations can integrate SaaS applications with other software using application programming interfaces (APIs). For example, a business can write its own software tools and use the SaaS provider's APIs to integrate those
                                    tools with the SaaS offering. <a href="#4">[4]</a>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>PaaS</b>-Perform as a Service
                                <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise
                                    applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.</p>
                                <p>Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure – servers, storage and networking – but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems and more. PaaS is designed to support
                                    the complete web application life cycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.
                                </p>
                                <p>PaaS allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing software licences, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware, container orchestrators such as Kubernetes or the development tools
                                    and other resources. You manage the applications and services that you develop, and the cloud service provider typically manages everything else.
                                    <a href="#5">[5]</a></p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>IaaS</b>-Infastructure as a Service
                                <p>Infrastructure-as-a-Service, commonly referred to as simply “IaaS,” is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go
                                    basis. IaaS enables end users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high, up-front capital expenditures or unnecessary “owned” infrastructure, especially in the case of “spiky” workloads.
                                    In contrast to PaaS and SaaS (even newer computing models like containers and serverless), IaaS provides the lowest-level control of resources in the cloud.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    IaaS emerged as a popular computing model in the early 2010s, and since that time, it has become the standard abstraction model for many types of workloads. However, with the advent of new technologies, such as containers and serverless, and the related
                                    rise of the microservices application pattern, IaaS remains foundational but is in a more crowded field than ever.

                        We have used LabView to design the blackbox system to create Air Heater model. we have used control and Simulation and used PID controller to stabilize the control system. We have also used OPC in labview to communicate between our server and our conrtrol
                        system. It is a machine to machine communication protocol for industrial automation. And then, we have used SQL server to store in our SQL database. To manage the SQL database, we have used Microsoft SQL Management Studio. And
                        then, we created a SQL database in the Azure cloud system. Moreover, we have created Web App to visualize the data in real time, in ASP.Net programming. And we have used Visual Studio as our IDE, and used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap as
                        our frontend. Later,we have deployed our app in Azure Cloud system.
